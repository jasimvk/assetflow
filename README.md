Got it. Here’s an extensive, Copilot-ready README for your project with all the requested details. I’ve structured it to be detailed enough that GitHub Copilot or any AI assistant could scaffold most of the code for you.

Backend API Endpoints

Endpoint	Method	Description
/api/assets	GET	Fetch all assets (role-based)
/api/assets	POST	Submit a new asset request
/api/assets/:id	PUT	Update asset details
/api/assets/:id	DELETE	Retire an asset
/api/assets/:id/approve	POST	Approve/Reject asset
/api/approvals	GET	Fetch pending approvals for the logged-in user


⸻

Approval Workflow
	1.	User submits asset form → Status: Pending Approval
	2.	Backend identifies approvers based on asset type, cost, or department
	3.	Emails sent to approvers via Microsoft Graph API
	4.	Approver submits decision → backend updates asset status
	5.	Submitter receives notification with the outcome
	6.	Audit trail updated for all actions

Supabase Database Tables (Simplified)

Assets

Column	Type	Notes
id	UUID	Primary Key
name	String	Asset name
type	String	Category
serial_number	String	Optional
value	Number	Cost/value of asset
status	Enum	Pending, Approved, Rejected, Retired
created_by	String	AD user ID
assigned_to	String	AD user ID (optional)
created_at	Timestamp	Auto-generated

AssetApprovals

Column	Type	Notes
id	UUID	Primary Key
asset_id	UUID	Foreign key → Assets.id
approver_id	String	AD user ID
status	Enum	Pending, Approved, Rejected
comments	Text	Optional
created_at	Timestamp	Auto-generated


⸻

Authentication Flow
	1.	User clicks “Sign in with Microsoft” → MSAL.js handles login
	2.	Entra ID validates credentials and returns ID & access tokens
	3.	Token sent to backend → verified with MSAL Node
	4.	Backend identifies user roles from AD groups
	5.	Role-based access applied throughout the app

⸻

Email Notifications via Microsoft Graph API
	•	Sends approval requests to approvers
	•	Submitters receive outcome notifications
	•	Graph API integration ensures emails are sent via corporate accounts

Example workflow:

POST /assets/:id/approve
Backend sends Graph API email to:
- Approver (on submission)
- Submitter (after decision)


⸻

Deployment
	•	Frontend: Vercel → connect GitHub repo, deploy Next.js app
	•	Backend: Vercel Functions → host Express APIs
	•	Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard

I can also create a Copilot-ready folder structure with stub files, API routes, MSAL auth templates, and Graph API email functions, so you can literally start coding without writing boilerplate.

Do you want me to create that next?
